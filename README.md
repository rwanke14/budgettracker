## Description

This application is a budget tracker for employees to use when they are traveling to track their expenses. It has a form set up that allows you to input the expense name and amount, then either hit subtract or add amount. Below the buttons the user will see a list of their expenses and a chart displaying a line chart of their expense history.

The application can be run online or offline. It uses mongodb when it's only along with indexdb for an assist while the network is offline. That way you can still track your additions to your database while you are offline.
